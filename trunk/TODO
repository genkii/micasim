* Details of Simulation
** Check integrator energy-scaling behavior:
*** DKD: 2nd order
*** KDK: 2nd order
*** Hermite: 4th order

** Energy HUD (instead of output to INFO log)

** Velocity in ICs
Add ability to set the velocity (maybe with a script on the prim?) in
the initial conditions.

* Forward-thinking

** API for External Code
We want to implement an API so that we can communicate with others'
n-body code (already written).

** Script Physics
Maybe write a physics engine which queries prims about whether they
would like to supply their own physics, or use a default engine.
Would allow to put the simulation code into the prims rather than a
plugin.

** Visualization 

*** Visualize 4-D data
Simulation data comes in 4-D (3 space and 1 time).  Allow those four
dimensions to be mapped onto the four dimensions of the virtual world
in any arbitrary way.  For example, allow for visualization of the
evolution of an orbiting system with x -> x, y -> y, and t -> z.  As
the system evolves in time, the image in the virtual world becomes a
double-helix running up the z-axis.
